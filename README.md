### Description

Welcome to eSewa!!:green_circle:

Here you will learn the basics of creating an eSewa account. This is the first project that was assigned to me . At first , I gave a lot of thought to what I should base the projectÂ on. Though I decided on the eSewa system only three days before the due date (because to my procrastination in researching alternative options), I hope to someday tackle more challenging projects and ace at it.

### Instructions

- Firstly, you'll have to register an account and answer all the questions asked
- Then, after successfully registering the account, you'd have to go through the log in process
- There, you'll be given a variety of options
- It is better to load money into your account at first
- Then you're free to go!! You can send money to another account, check your balance, and even change your passcode!
- Congrats on successfully using your own eSewa account :star_struck:

### Important features used
